# Decision_Tree

Kyphosis is  an abnormally excessive convex curvature of the spine. 
The dataset used in this project contains data whether the state of Kyphosis is present / absent after the operation , Age of the person (in months), the number is a number of vertebrae involved in the operation and the start is the no. of first or the top most vertebrae that was operated on.

Steps:
1. Import all the essential libraries
2. Import the dataset
3. Check the information of dataset like no of entries
4. Data analysis for better visualisation using seaborn 
5. Splitted the data in training and test set
6. Imported DecisionTreeClassifier from skleran.tree for classificaion
7. Created a model for DecisionTreeClassifier
8. Fit the trained data in model
9. Created a predictions instance for dtree and passed the test set
10. From sklearn.maetrics import classification-report and confusion metrix.
11. Printed the values ofconfusion matrix and classification_report.
12.  
13.
